The server solution is in the master branch.

The .net2.0 client solution is in the master-client branch.

The two branches master and master-client are two separate projects for server and client.
The server and client have been tested to support uploading logs from client to server.

The client is a windows console app that tries to upload logs when it is run.
It needs a keypress to close to display the outcome of the run session.
